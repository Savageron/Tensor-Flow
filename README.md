"Magnus" contains the simplified cifar10 version of Convolutional Neural Network for processing the Iheya_n files

"cifar10_on_Iheya" contains the actual cifar10 version of Convolutional Neural Network for processing the Iheya_n files, but is discontinued as it is too complicated and time consuming to alter the algorithm to produce desired outputs.

"non_tf_imgprocess" contains the codes to process the raw images/mosaic to produce an output in the desired format for feeding into the Convolutional Neural Network.
